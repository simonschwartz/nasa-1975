# The NASA Logotype

This logotype is the central element in NASA's visual communications system. Through consistent and repetitive use as a signature device and design element in all of NASA's visual
communications, the logotype becomes a visual shorthand which identifies the Agency and symbol ically embodies its activities, achievements and goals.

In the logotype, the letters N-A-S-A are reduced to their most simplified form. The strokes are all of one width, evoking the qualities of unity and technical precision. Elimination of
cross-strokes in the two "A" letters imparts a vertical thrust to the logotype and lends it a quality of uniqueness and contemporary character.

The logotype should never be altered or distorted in any way. It must not be re-drawn, but rather reproduced photographically from reproduction artwork included in Section 2 of
this manual.
