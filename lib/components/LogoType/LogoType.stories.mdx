# Logo Type

To identify the agency, as a total entity, the NASA logotype is shown in conjunction with the full
agency name (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) as shown below.

<div style={{ margin: '3rem 0' }}>
    <LogoType theme="dark" size="lg" style={{ marginBottom: '2rem' }} />
    <LogoType theme="dark" size="md" style={{ marginBottom: '2rem' }} />
    <LogoType theme="dark" size="sm" />
</div>

## Use with color

### White Background

Against a white background the logoÂ­type may be shown in NASA red or black.

<StoryContainer>
    <LogoType theme="dark" />
</StoryContainer>

<StoryContainer>
    <LogoType theme="red" />
</StoryContainer>

### Very Light Value Background

Against a very light background, the logotype should be shown in black.

The one exception to this would be the use of NASA red logotype in very light areas of four-color
process reproduction.

<StoryContainer background="medium">
    <LogoType theme="dark" />
</StoryContainer>

<StoryContainer background="medium">
    <LogoType theme="red" />
</StoryContainer>

### Black or very dark background

Against a black or very dark color background, the logotype should always be shown in white .

The logotype should always be shown in white against a background of NASA red. The logotype should
never be shown in NASA red against a black or very dark background.

<StoryContainer background="dark">
    <LogoType theme="light" />
</StoryContainer>

<StoryContainer background="red">
    <LogoType theme="light" />
</StoryContainer>

### Medium-Value Background

Against a medium-value background, the logotype may be shown in either black or white, depending on
which is more appropriate.

The logotype should never be shown in NASA red against a medium-value background.

<StoryContainer background="grey">
    <LogoType theme="light" />
</StoryContainer>

<StoryContainer background="grey">
    <LogoType theme="dark" />
</StoryContainer>

### Center Identification

The NASA logotype and it's attendant elements of style are always a required element in any NASA
publication.

To identify any of the NASA centers the NASA logotype and full agency name is shown in conjunction
with the full center name (John F. Kennedy Space Center) as shown below.

The bold lettering style assures that the center name receives primary emphasis even though it is
always preceded by the agency name and accompanied by the NASA logo-type.

<StoryContainer>
    <LogoType theme="dark" centerName="John F. Kennedy Space Center" />
</StoryContainer>

<StoryContainer>
    <LogoType theme="red" centerName="John F. Kennedy Space Center" />
</StoryContainer>

<StoryContainer background="dark">
    <LogoType theme="light" centerName="John F. Kennedy Space Center" />
</StoryContainer>
