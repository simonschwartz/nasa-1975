**Dear Colleagues:**

A driving force and the use of innovative techniques and ideas have brought NASA the image of a
get-it-done agency, and the record backs up the reputation .

As we move ahead to an even more exciting era in aeronautical research and space exploration, we
have added a new tool to enhance and symbolize the progressive path we have always followed.

Not as suspenseful as a Command and Service Module splashdown nor as dramatic as a Mariner flyby, it
is nonetheless of major importance because it is designed to achieve maximum communication of the
agency's program objectives, both internally and externally.

I think the new logotype is pleasing to the eye and gives a feeling of unity, technological
precision, thrust and orientation toward the future. Unity, technology, pioneering
achievement-that's what NASA is all about.

This manual is a reference book for NASA designers. It is the official policy document regarding
NASA identification (use of logotype), communication in general and sets the tone and level of
quality for all NASA graphics.

## Getting started

Install the NASA 1975 design system

```
npm install --save nasa-1975
```

NASA 1975 has a peer dependency of [@emotion/core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@emotion/core). If
your project doesn't already use it, install it with:

```
npm install --save @emotion/core
```

### Usage

Here is a quick example to get you started.

```
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import { LogoType } from 'nasa-1975';

function App() {
  return (
    <LogoType theme="red" />
  );
}

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.querySelector('#app'));

```
